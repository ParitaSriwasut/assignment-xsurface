# Assignment xsurface

There are 5 questions and A to D are in the coding-question directory and question E is the webapp-question directory.

## Coding questions

The way to run the code and the output are described in the [coding question's README.md](coding-question/README.md).

## Web App question

Check out the web app at: https://assignment-xsurface-cjrt.vercel.app

The directory has two separate folders one is for the backend and another one for the frontend. The way to run them is described in their respective readme.

[Backend README.md](webapp-question/backend/README.md)
[Frontend README.md](webapp-question/frontend/README.md)

Deployment for each of them is done on Vercel through its direct integration with Github. When the code is pushed to the main branch frontend and backend are deployed separately to two different Vercel domains

Frontend: https://assignment-xsurface-cjrt.vercel.app
Backend: https://assignment-xsurface-ashy.vercel.app
